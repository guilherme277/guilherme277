### Hi for all guys! ğŸ‘‹

I'm Guilherme AssunÃ§Ã£o, I was born in 1997 in Fortaleza, CearÃ¡. I'm a programmer but I have few courses, my career is based on free courses and tutorials on YouTube, not to mention the language documentation.

Today I know Kotlin, Flutter and Java
I also like to discover things in the Android source code, but I'm not very good at it ğŸ˜„
